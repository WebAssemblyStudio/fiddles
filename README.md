# Julia Set

This is an example of more complex computations needed to generate a fractal (Julia Set).
It's also an example of direct interaction with CanvasRenderingContext2D's API via `#[wasm_bindgen]` macro.

You can build the example with:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

(or running the commands on Windows manually)

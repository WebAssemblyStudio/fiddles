# Closure examples

This is an example of using the `#[wasm_bindgen]` macro with closures
to interact with the DOM.

Hit "Build" and then "Run" up top and the iframe should then have a clickable green square and an updating timer.

Be sure to check out this [example on GitHub][gh] or the [`hello_world`][hello] example which should have some more comments and such.

# Adding numbers

This is an example of using the `#[wasm_bindgen]` macro to add numbers and otherwise generate a minimal wasm module.

Hit "Build" and then "Run" up top and you should see some addition being done in an alert.

Be sure to check out this [example on GitHub][gh] or the [`hello_world`][hello] example which should have some more comments and such.

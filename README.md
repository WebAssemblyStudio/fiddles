# Timing Prime

This example compares JavaScript and WebAssembly performance counting prime numbers.

The JavaScript implementations are in `main.js` and the C implementations are in `main.c`. The C implementations are compiled to WebAssembly when you `Build` the example.

`Build` the program and then `Run` to count all the prime numbers less then 2^22. You can change the max number (n) in `main.js`.

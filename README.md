# Math

This is an example of using the `#[wasm_bindgen]` macro to access the `Math` object and performing various calculations.

Hit "Build" and then "Run" up top and you should see some math being done in the console below.

Be sure to check out this [example on GitHub][gh] or the [`hello_world`][hello] example which should have some more comments and such.

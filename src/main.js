// Note that for webassembly.studio we're using the CLI's `--no-modules` option
// which may not be what you're using locally (aka using ES modules/Webpack).
// Since we're using `--no-modules` the `wasm_bindgen` global is initialized 
// to the exports of our module, and then below initialization is slightly
// different.
//
// When using wasm-bindgen locally and a different bundler like Webpack (or 
// a different option like `--nodejs`) these integration points will be
// tweaked slightly, and you can consult https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen
// for more information.

function runApp() {
  console.log(typeof greet('World'));
}

// Load and instantiate the wasm file, and we specify the source of the wasm
// file here. Once the returned promise is resolved we're ready to go and
// use our imports.
wasm_bindgen('../out/main_bg.wasm').then(runApp);
